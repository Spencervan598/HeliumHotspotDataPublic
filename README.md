Pull data from api.helium.io and displays in gui.

This is just a personal project to familiarize myself with tkinter a bit more. Will flesh out and add more functionality when time allows.

No longer just a personal project, will be adding functionality that would have been in AirtableScript.

This is no longer being actively worked on. A few weeks after previous commit, client and I decided to stop working on it, as other software/apps had been released that provided the needed functionality.
